  independent quantities. That’s certainly true for the sample mean. However, it’s also possible to write many other
  sample statistics as averages of one form or another. The variance of a sample, for instance, can be rewritten
  as a kind of average and so is subject to the law of large numbers. The minimum value of a sample,
  however, cannot be written as an average of anything and is therefore not governed by the law of large
  numbers.</span></p></div>
