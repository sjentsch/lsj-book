   Neither of these appeals to me all that much. Relatedly, I ﬁnd it depressing that almost nobody in the psychological
   literature ever bothers to report which Type of tests they ran, much less the order of variables (for Type I) or
   the contrasts used (for Type III). Often they don’t report what software they used either. The only
   way I can ever make any sense of what people typically report is to try to guess from auxiliary cues
   which software they were using, and to assume that they never changed the default settings. Please
   don’t do this! Now that you know about these issues make sure you indicate what software you used,
   and if you’re reporting ANOVA results for unbalanced data, then specify what Type of tests you ran,
   specify order information if you’ve done Type I tests and specify contrasts if you’ve done Type III tests.
   Or, even better, do hypotheses tests that correspond to things you really care about and then report
   those!</span></p></div>
