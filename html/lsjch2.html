<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >In this chapter, we’re going to start thinking about the basic ideas that go into designing a study,
collecting data, checking whether your data collection works, and so on. It won’t give you enough
information to allow you to design studies of your own, but it will give you a lot of the basic tools
that you need to assess the studies done by other people. However, since the focus of this book is
much more on data analysis than on data collection, I’m only giving a very brief overview. Note
that this chapter is “special” in two ways. Firstly, it’s much more psychology-speciﬁc than the later
chapters. Secondly, it focuses much more heavily on the scientiﬁc problem of research
methodology, and much less on the statistical problem of data analysis. Nevertheless, the two
problems are related to one another, so it’s traditional for stats textbooks to discuss the
problem in a little detail. This chapter relies heavily on Campbell and Stanley (1963)
for the discussion of study design, and Stevens (1946) for the discussion of scales of
measurement.

<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >Measurement itself is a subtle concept, but basically it comes down to ﬁnding some way of
assigning numbers, or labels, or some other kind of well-deﬁned descriptions, to “stuﬀ”. So, any of
the following would count as a psychological measurement:
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">My age is 33 years.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">I do not like anchovies.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">My chromosomal gender is male.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">My self-identiﬁed gender is male.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="lsj12.html#fn2x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x10-12001f2"></a> </li></ul>
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   In the short list above, the bolded part is “the thing to be measured”, and the italicised part is
“the measurement itself”. In fact, we can expand on this a little bit, by thinking about the set of
possible measurements that could have arisen in each case:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">My age (in years) could have been 0, 1, 2, 3 …, etc. The upper bound on what my age
      could possibly be is a bit fuzzy, but in practice you’d be safe in saying that the largest
      possible age is 150, since no human has ever lived that long.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">When asked if I like anchovies, I might have said that I do, or I do not, or I have no
      opinion, or I sometimes do.
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">My chromosomal gender is almost certainly going to be male (XY) or female (XX),
      but there are a few other possibilities. I could also have Klinfelter’s syndrome (XXY),
      which is more similar to male than to female. And I imagine there are other possibilities
      too.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">My self-identiﬁed gender is also very likely to be male or female, but it doesn’t have
      to agree with my chromosomal gender. I may also choose to identify with neither, or
      to explicitly call myself transgender.</li></ul>
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   As you can see, for some things (like age) it seems fairly obvious what the set of possible
measurements should be, whereas for other things it gets a bit tricky. But I want to point out that
even in the case of someone’s age it’s much more subtle than this. For instance, in the example
above I assumed that it was okay to measure age in years. But if you’re a developmental
psychologist, that’s way too crude, and so you often measure age in years and months (if a
child is 2 years and 11 months this is usually written as “2;11”). If you’re interested in
newborns you might want to measure age in days since birth, maybe even hours since
birth. In other words, the way in which you specify the allowable measurement values is
important.
</p><!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   Looking at this a bit more closely, you might also realise that the concept of “age” isn’t actually
all that precise. In general, when we say “age” we implicitly mean “the length of time since birth”.
But that’s not always the right way to do it. Suppose you’re interested in how newborn babies
control their eye movements. If you’re interested in kids that young, you might also
start to worry that “birth” is not the only meaningful point in time to care about. If
Baby Alice is born 3 weeks premature and Baby Bianca is born 1 week late, would
it really make sense to say that they are the “same age” if we encountered them “2
hours after birth”? In one sense, yes. By social convention we use birth as our reference
point for talking about age in everyday life, since it deﬁnes the amount of time the
person has been operating as an independent entity in the world. But from a scientiﬁc
perspective that’s not the only thing we care about. When we think about the biology
of human beings, it’s often useful to think of ourselves as organisms that have been
growing and maturing since conception, and from that perspective Alice and Bianca
aren’t the same age at all. So you might want to deﬁne the concept of “age” in two
diﬀerent ways: the length of time since conception and the length of time since birth. When
dealing with adults it won’t make much diﬀerence, but when dealing with newborns it
might.
</p><!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   Moving beyond these issues, there’s the question of methodology. What speciﬁc “measurement
method” are you going to use to ﬁnd out someone’s age? As before, there are lots of diﬀerent
possibilities:
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">You could just ask people “how old are you?” The method of self-report is fast, cheap
      and easy. But it only works with people old enough to understand the question, and
      some people lie about their age.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">You could ask an authority (e.g., a parent) “how old is your child?” This method is
      fast, and when dealing with kids it’s not all that hard since the parent is almost always
      around. It doesn’t work as well if you want to know “age since conception”, since a lot
      of parents can’t say for sure when conception took place. For that, you might need a
      diﬀerent authority (e.g., an obstetrician).
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">You could look up oﬃcial records, for example birth or death certiﬁcates. This is a
      time consuming and frustrating endeavour, but it has its uses (e.g., if the person is now
      dead).</li></ul>

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1.2   </span> <a 
 id="x10-130002.1.2"></a>Operationalisation: deﬁning your measurement</h4>
<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >All of the ideas discussed in the previous section relate to the concept of <span id="textcolor9">operationalisation</span>. To
be a bit more precise about the idea, operationalisation is the process by which we take a
meaningful but somewhat vague concept and turn it into a precise measurement. The process of
operationalisation can involve several diﬀerent things:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">Being precise about what you are trying to measure. For instance, does “age” mean
      “time since birth” or “time since conception” in the context of your research?
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Determining what method you will use to measure it. Will you use self-report to measure
      age, ask a parent, or look up an oﬃcial record? If you’re using self-report, how will you
      phrase the question?
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Deﬁning the set of allowable values that the measurement can take. Note that these
      values don’t always have to be numerical, though they often are. When measuring age
      the values are numerical, but we still need to think carefully about what numbers are
      allowed. Do we want age in years, years and months, days, or hours? For other types of
      measurements (e.g., gender) the values aren’t numerical. But, just as before, we need to
      think about what values are allowed. If we’re asking people to self-report their gender,
      what options to we allow them to choose between? Is it enough to allow only “male”
      or “female”? Do you need an “other” option? Or should we not give people speciﬁc
      options and instead let them answer in their own words? And if you open up the set of
      possible values to include all verbal response, how will you interpret their answers?</li></ul>
<!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >   Operationalisation is a tricky business, and there’s no “one, true way” to do it. The way
in which you choose to operationalise the informal concept of “age” or “gender” into
a formal measurement depends on what you need to use the measurement for. Often
you’ll ﬁnd that the community of scientists who work in your area have some fairly
well-established ideas for how to go about it. In other words, operationalisation needs to be
thought through on a case by case basis. Nevertheless, while there a lot of issues that are
speciﬁc to each individual research project, there are some aspects to it that are pretty
general.
</p><!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >   Before moving on I want to take a moment to clear up our terminology, and in the process
introduce one more term. Here are four diﬀerent things that are closely related to each
other:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize"><span id="textcolor10">A theoretical construct</span>. This is the thing that you’re trying to take a measurement
      of,  like  “age”,  “gender”  or  an  “opinion”.  A  theoretical  construct  can’t  be  directly
      observed, and often they’re actually a bit vague.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span id="textcolor11">A measure</span>. The measure refers to the method or the tool that you use to make your
      observations. A question in a survey, a behavioural observation or a brain scan could
      all count as a measure.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span id="textcolor12">An operationalisation</span>. The term “operationalisation” refers to the logical connection
      between the measure and the theoretical construct, or to the process by which we try
      to derive a measure from a theoretical construct.
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span id="textcolor13">A variable</span>. Finally, a new term. A variable is what we end up with when we apply
      our measure to something in the world. That is, variables are the actual “data” that
      we end up with in our data sets.</li></ul>
<!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" >In practice, even scientists tend to blur the distinction between these things, but it’s very helpful to
try to understand the diﬀerences.

<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" >As the previous section indicates, the outcome of a psychological measurement is called a variable.
But not all variables are of the same qualitative type and so it’s useful to understand what types
there are. A very useful concept for distinguishing between diﬀerent types of variables is what’s
known as <span id="textcolor14">scales of measurement</span>.

</p>
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.2.1   </span> <a 
 id="x10-150002.2.1"></a>Nominal scale</h4>
<!--l. 83--><p class="noindent" >A <span id="textcolor15">nominal scale</span> variable (also referred to as a <span id="textcolor16">categorical</span> variable) is one in which
there is no particular relationship between the diﬀerent possibilities. For these kinds
of variables it doesn’t make any sense to say that one of them is “bigger’ or “better”
than any other one, and it absolutely doesn’t make any sense to average them. The
classic example for this is “eye colour”. Eyes can be blue, green or brown, amongst other
possibilities, but none of them is any “bigger” than any other one. As a result, it would
feel really weird to talk about an “average eye colour”. Similarly, gender is nominal
too: male isn’t better or worse than female. Neither does it make sense to try to talk
about an “average gender”. In short, nominal scale variables are those for which the
only thing you can say about the diﬀerent possibilities is that they are diﬀerent. That’s
it.
</p><!--l. 85--><p class="indent" >   Let’s take a slightly closer look at this. Suppose I was doing research on how people commute to
and from work. One variable I would have to measure would be what kind of transportation people
use to get to work. This “transport type” variable could have quite a few possible values, including:
“train”, “bus”, “car”, “bicycle”. For now, let’s suppose that these four are the only
possibilities. Then imagine that I ask 100 people how they got to work today, with this

An ordinal scale variable is one in which there is a natural, meaningful way to order the
diﬀerent possibilities, but you can’t do anything else. The usual example given of an
ordinal variable is “ﬁnishing position in a race”. You can say that the person who ﬁnished
ﬁrst was faster than the person who ﬁnished second, but you don’t know how much
faster. As a consequence we know that 1st   2nd, and we know that 2nd   3rd, but the
diﬀerence between 1st and 2nd might be much larger than the diﬀerence between 2nd and
3rd.

degrees celsius. For instance, if it was 15<sup> </sup> yesterday and 18<sup> </sup> today, then the 3<sup> </sup> diﬀerence between
the two is genuinely meaningful. Moreover, that 3<sup> </sup> diﬀerence is exactly the same as the 3<sup> </sup> diﬀerence

to record the year in which each student started. This is an interval scale variable. A
student who started in 2003 did arrive 5 years before a student who started in 2008.
However, it would be completely daft for me to divide 2008 by 2003 and say that the second
student started “1.0024 times later” than the ﬁrst one. That doesn’t make any sense at
all.

<!--l. 171--><p class="noindent" >The fourth and ﬁnal type of variable to consider is a <span id="textcolor20">ratio scale</span> variable, in which zero really
means zero, and it’s okay to multiply and divide. A good psychological example of a ratio scale
variable is response time (RT). In a lot of tasks it’s very common to record the amount of time
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
somebody takes to solve a problem or answer a question, because it’s an indicator of how diﬃcult
the task is. Suppose that Alan takes 2.3 seconds to respond to a question, whereas Ben
takes 3.1 seconds. As with an interval scale variable, addition and subtraction are both
meaningful here. Ben really did take 3.1   2.3   0.8 seconds longer than Alan did. However,
notice that multiplication and division also make sense here too: Ben took 3.1{2.3   1.35
times as long as Alan did to answer the question. And the reason why you can do this is
that for a ratio scale variable such as RT “zero seconds” really does mean “no time at
all”.

<!--l. 175--><p class="noindent" >There’s a second kind of distinction that you need to be aware of, regarding what types of variables
you can run into. This is the distinction between continuous variables and discrete variables. The
diﬀerence between these is as follows:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">A <span id="textcolor21">continuous variable</span> is one in which, for any two values that you can think of, it’s
      always logically possible to have another value in between.

      <li class="itemize">A <span id="textcolor22">discrete variable</span> is, in eﬀect, a variable that isn’t continuous. For a discrete variable
      it’s sometimes the case that there’s nothing in the middle.</li></ul>
<!--l. 182--><p class="indent" >   These deﬁnitions probably seem a bit abstract, but they’re pretty simple once you see some
examples. For instance, response time is continuous. If Alan takes 3.1 seconds and Ben takes 2.3
seconds to respond to a question, then Cameron’s response time will lie in between if he took 3.0
seconds. And of course it would also be possible for David to take 3.031 seconds to respond,
meaning that his RT would lie in between Cameron’s and Alan’s. And while in practice it might be
impossible to measure RT that precisely, it’s certainly possible in principle. Because we can always
ﬁnd a new value for RT in between any two other ones we regard RT as a continuous
measure.
</p><!--l. 184--><p class="indent" >   Discrete variables occur when this rule is violated. For example, nominal scale variables are
always discrete. There isn’t a type of transportation that falls “in between” trains and bicycles, not
in the strict mathematical way that 2.3 falls in between 2 and 3. So transportation type is
discrete. Similarly, ordinal scale variables are always discrete. Although “2nd place”
does fall between “1st place” and “3rd place”, there’s nothing that can logically fall
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
in between “1st place” and “2nd place”. Interval scale and ratio scale variables can
go either way. As we saw above, response time (a ratio scale variable) is continuous.
Temperature in degrees celsius (an interval scale variable) is also continuous. However, the year
you went to school (an interval scale variable) is discrete. There’s no year in between
2002 and 2003. The number of questions you get right on a true-or-false test (a ratio
scale variable) is also discrete. Since a true-or-false question doesn’t allow you to be
“partially correct”, there’s nothing in between 5/10 and 6/10. Table <a 
href="#x10-190011">2.1<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:scalescont --></a> summarises the
relationship between the scales of measurement and the discrete/continuity distinction.
Cells with a tick mark correspond to things that are possible. I’m trying to hammer
this point home, because (a) some textbooks get this wrong, and (b) people very often
say things like “discrete variable” when they mean “nominal scale variable”. It’s very
unfortunate.

little classiﬁcation scheme suggests. Very few variables in real life actually fall into these nice neat

about the situations in which you should treat diﬀerent variables diﬀerently. Nothing
more.
</p><!--l. 209--><p class="indent" >   So let’s take a classic example, maybe the classic example, of a psychological measurement tool:
the <span id="textcolor23">Likert scale</span>. The humble Likert scale is the bread and butter tool of all survey design. You
yourself have ﬁlled out hundreds, maybe thousands, of them and odds are you’ve even used one
yourself. Suppose we have a survey question that looks like this:

<!--l. 229--><p class="indent" >   Likert scales are very handy, if somewhat limited, tools. The question is what kind of variable
are they? They’re obviously discrete, since you can’t give a response of 2.5. They’re obviously not
nominal scale, since the items are ordered; and they’re not ratio scale either, since there’s no
natural zero.
</p><!--l. 231--><p class="indent" >   But are they ordinal scale or interval scale? One argument says that we can’t really
prove that the diﬀerence between “strongly agree” and “agree” is of the same size as the
diﬀerence between “agree” and “neither agree nor disagree”. In fact, in everyday life it’s
pretty obvious that they’re not the same at all. So this suggests that we ought to treat
Likert scales as ordinal variables. On the other hand, in practice most participants do
seem to take the whole “on a scale from 1 to 5” part fairly seriously, and they tend
to act as if the diﬀerences between the ﬁve response options were fairly similar to one
another. As a consequence, a lot of researchers treat Likert scale data as interval
scale.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

<!--l. 235--><p class="noindent" >At this point we’ve thought a little bit about how to operationalise a theoretical construct and
thereby create a psychological measure. And we’ve seen that by applying psychological measures we
end up with variables, which can come in many diﬀerent types. At this point, we should start
discussing the obvious question: is the measurement any good? We’ll do this in terms of two related
ideas: reliability and validity. Put simply, the <span id="textcolor26">reliability</span> of a measure tells you how precisely you
are measuring something, whereas the validity of a measure tells you how accurate the
measure is. In this section I’ll talk about reliability; we’ll talk about validity in section
<a 
href="#x10-260002.6">2.6<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:validity --></a>.
</p><!--l. 237--><p class="indent" >   Reliability is actually a very simple concept. It refers to the repeatability or consistency of your
measurement. The measurement of my weight by means of a “bathroom scale” is very reliable. If I
step on and oﬀ the scales over and over again, it’ll keep giving me the same answer.
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
Measuring my intelligence by means of “asking my mum” is very unreliable. Some days
she tells me I’m a bit thick, and other days she tells me I’m a complete idiot. Notice
that this concept of reliability is diﬀerent to the question of whether the measurements
are correct (the correctness of a measurement relates to it’s validity). If I’m holding
a sack of potatos when I step on and oﬀ the bathroom scales the measurement will
still be reliable: it will always give me the same answer. However, this highly reliable
answer doesn’t match up to my true weight at all, therefore it’s wrong. In technical terms,
this is a reliable but invalid measurement. Similarly, whilst my mum’s estimate of my
intelligence is a bit unreliable, she might be right. Maybe I’m just not too bright, and
so while her estimate of my intelligence ﬂuctuates pretty wildly from day to day, it’s
basically right. That would be an unreliable but valid measure. Of course, if my mum’s
estimates are too unreliable it’s going to be very hard to ﬁgure out which one of her many
claims about my intelligence is actually the right one. To some extent, then, a very
unreliable measure tends to end up being invalid for practical purposes; so much so
that many people would say that reliability is necessary (but not suﬃcient) to ensure
validity.
</p><!--l. 239--><p class="indent" >   Okay, now that we’re clear on the distinction between reliability and validity, let’s have a think
about the diﬀerent ways in which we might measure reliability:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize"><span id="textcolor27">Test-retest  reliability</span>.  This  relates  to  consistency  over  time.  If  we  repeat  the
      measurement at a later date do we get a the same answer?
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span id="textcolor28">Inter-rater reliability</span>. This relates to consistency across people. If someone else
      repeats the measurement (e.g., someone else rates my intelligence) will they produce
      the same answer?
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span id="textcolor29">Parallel forms reliability</span>. This relates to consistency across theoretically-equivalent
      measurements. If I use a diﬀerent set of bathroom scales to measure my weight does it
      give the same answer?
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span id="textcolor30">Internal  consistency  reliability</span>.  If  a  measurement  is  constructed  from  lots  of
      diﬀerent parts that perform similar functions (e.g., a personality questionnaire result is
      added up across several questions) do the individual parts tend to give similar answers.
      We’ll look at this particular form of reliability later in the book, in Section <a 
href="lsjch15.html#x158-36600015.5">15.5<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rel --></a>.</li></ul>
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
<!--l. 248--><p class="indent" >   Not all measurements need to possess all forms of reliability. For instance, educational
assessment can be thought of as a form of measurement. One of the subjects that I teach,
Computational Cognitive Science, has an assessment structure that has a research component and
an exam component (plus other things). The exam component is intended to measure something
diﬀerent from the research component, so the assessment as a whole has low internal consistency.
However, within the exam there are several questions that are intended to (approximately)
measure the same things, and those tend to produce similar outcomes. So the exam
on its own has a fairly high internal consistency. Which is as it should be. You should
only demand reliability in those situations where you want to be measuring the same
thing!

 id="x10-220002.4"></a>The “role” of variables: predictors and outcomes </h3>
<!--l. 253--><p class="noindent" >I’ve got one last piece of terminology that I need to explain to you before moving away from
variables. Normally, when we do some research we end up with lots of diﬀerent variables. Then,
when we analyse our data, we usually try to explain some of the variables in terms of some of the
other variables. It’s important to keep the two roles “thing doing the explaining” and “thing being
explained” distinct. So let’s be clear about this now. First, we might as well get used to the idea of
using mathematical symbols to describe variables, since it’s going to happen over and over again.
Let’s denote the “to be explained” variable Y , and denote the variables “doing the explaining” as
X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, etc.
</p><!--l. 255--><p class="indent" >   When we are doing an analysis we have diﬀerent names for X and Y , since they play diﬀerent
roles in the analysis. The classical names for these roles are <span id="textcolor31">independent variable</span> (IV) and
<span id="textcolor32">dependent variable</span> (DV). The IV is the variable that you use to do the explaining
(i.e., X) and the DV is the variable being explained (i.e., Y ). The logic behind these
names goes like this: if there really is a relationship between X and Y then we can
say that Y depends on X, and if we have designed our study “properly” then X isn’t
dependent on anything else. However, I personally ﬁnd those names horrible. They’re hard to
remember and they’re highly misleading because (a) the IV is never actually “independent of
everything else”, and (b) if there’s no relationship then the DV doesn’t actually depend
on the IV. And in fact, because I’m not the only person who thinks that IV and DV
are just awful names, there are a number of alternatives that I ﬁnd more appealing.
The terms that I’ll use in this book are <span id="textcolor33">predictors</span> and <span id="textcolor34">outcomes</span>. The idea here is
that what you’re trying to do is use X (the predictors) to make guesses about Y (the

<!--l. 275--><p class="noindent" >One of the big distinctions that you should be aware of is the distinction between “experimental
research” and “non-experimental research”. When we make this distinction, what we’re really
talking about is the degree of control that the researcher exercises over the people and events in the
study.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.5.1   </span> <a 
 id="x10-240002.5.1"></a>Experimental research</h4>
<!--l. 279--><p class="noindent" >The key feature of <span id="textcolor36">experimental research</span> is that the researcher controls all aspects of
the study, especially what participants experience during the study. In particular, the
researcher manipulates or varies the predictor variables (IVs) but allows the outcome
variable (DV) to vary naturally. The idea here is to deliberately vary the predictors (IVs)
to see if they have any causal eﬀects on the outcomes. Moreover, in order to ensure
that there’s no possibility that something other than the predictor variables is causing
the outcomes, everything else is kept constant or is in some other way “balanced”, to
ensure that they have no eﬀect on the results. In practice, it’s almost impossible to
think of everything else that might have an inﬂuence on the outcome of an experiment,
much less keep it constant. The standard solution to this is <span id="textcolor37">randomisation</span>. That is,
we randomly assign people to diﬀerent groups, and then give each group a diﬀerent
treatment (i.e., assign them diﬀerent values of the predictor variables). We’ll talk more about
randomisation later, but for now it’s enough to say that what randomisation does is minimise
(but not eliminate) the possibility that there are any systematic diﬀerence between
groups.
</p><!--l. 281--><p class="indent" >   Let’s consider a very simple, completely unrealistic and grossly unethical example. Suppose you
wanted to ﬁnd out if smoking causes lung cancer. One way to do this would be to ﬁnd people who
smoke and people who don’t smoke and look to see if smokers have a higher rate of lung cancer.
This is not a proper experiment, since the researcher doesn’t have a lot of control over who is and
isn’t a smoker. And this really matters. For instance, it might be that people who choose to smoke
cigarettes also tend to have poor diets, or maybe they tend to work in asbestos mines, or whatever.
The point here is that the groups (smokers and non-smokers) actually diﬀer on lots of
things, not just smoking. So it might be that the higher incidence of lung cancer among
smokers is caused by something else, and not by smoking per se. In technical terms these
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
other things (e.g. diet) are called “confounders”, and we’ll talk about those in just a
moment.
</p><!--l. 283--><p class="indent" >   In the meantime, let’s consider what a proper experiment might look like. Recall that our
concern was that smokers and non-smokers might diﬀer in lots of ways. The solution, as long as you
have no ethics, is to control who smokes and who doesn’t. Speciﬁcally, if we randomly divide young
non-smokers into two groups and force half of them to become smokers, then it’s very
unlikely that the groups will diﬀer in any respect other than the fact that half of them
smoke. That way, if our smoking group gets cancer at a higher rate than the non-smoking
group, we can feel pretty conﬁdent that (a) smoking does cause cancer and (b) we’re
murderers.

</p>
   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.5.2   </span> <a 
 id="x10-250002.5.2"></a>Non-experimental research</h4>
<!--l. 287--><p class="noindent" ><span id="textcolor38">Non-experimental research</span> is a broad term that covers “any study in which the researcher
doesn’t have as much control as they do in an experiment”. Obviously, control is something that
scientists like to have, but as the previous example illustrates there are lots of situations
in which you can’t or shouldn’t try to obtain that control. Since it’s grossly unethical
(and almost certainly criminal) to force people to smoke in order to ﬁnd out if they get
cancer, this is a good example of a situation in which you really shouldn’t try to obtain
experimental control. But there are other reasons too. Even leaving aside the ethical
issues, our “smoking experiment” does have a few other issues. For instance, when I
suggested that we “force” half of the people to become smokers, I was talking about starting
with a sample of non-smokers, and then forcing them to become smokers. While this
sounds like the kind of solid, evil experimental design that a mad scientist would love, it
might not be a very sound way of investigating the eﬀect in the real world. For instance,
suppose that smoking only causes lung cancer when people have poor diets, and suppose
also that people who normally smoke do tend to have poor diets. However, since the
“smokers” in our experiment aren’t “natural” smokers (i.e., we forced non-smokers to become
smokers, but they didn’t take on all of the other normal, real life characteristics that
smokers might tend to possess) they probably have better diets. As such, in this silly
example they wouldn’t get lung cancer and our experiment will fail, because it violates
the structure of the “natural” world (the technical name for this is an “artefactual”
result).
</p><!--l. 289--><p class="indent" >   One distinction worth making between two types of non-experimental research is the diﬀerence
between <span id="textcolor39">quasi-experimental research</span> and <span id="textcolor40">case studies</span>. The example I discussed earlier, in
which we wanted to examine incidence of lung cancer among smokers and non-smokers
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
without trying to control who smokes and who doesn’t, is a quasi-experimental design.
That is, it’s the same as an experiment but we don’t control the predictors (IVs). We
can still use statistics to analyse the results, but we have to be a lot more careful and
circumspect.
</p><!--l. 291--><p class="indent" >   The alternative approach, case studies, aims to provide a very detailed description of one or a
few instances. In general, you can’t use statistics to analyse the results of case studies and it’s
usually very hard to draw any general conclusions about “people in general” from a few isolated
examples. However, case studies are very useful in some situations. Firstly, there are situations
where you don’t have any alternative. Neuropsychology has this issue a lot. Sometimes, you
just can’t ﬁnd a lot of people with brain damage in a speciﬁc brain area, so the only
thing you can do is describe those cases that you do have in as much detail and with as
much care as you can. However, there’s also some genuine advantages to case studies.
Because you don’t have as many people to study you have the ability to invest lots of
time and eﬀort trying to understand the speciﬁc factors at play in each case. This is a
very valuable thing to do. As a consequence, case studies can complement the more
statistically-oriented approaches that you see in experimental and quasi-experimental designs. We
won’t talk much about case studies in this book, but they are nevertheless very valuable
tools!

 id="x10-260002.6"></a>Assessing the validity of a study </h3>
<!--l. 296--><p class="noindent" >More than any other thing, a scientist wants their research to be “valid”. The conceptual idea
behind <span id="textcolor41">validity</span> is very simple. Can you trust the results of your study? If not, the study is invalid.
However, whilst it’s easy to state, in practice it’s much harder to check validity than it is to check
reliability. And in all honesty, there’s no precise, clearly agreed upon notion of what validity
actually is. In fact, there are lots of diﬀerent kinds of validity, each of which raises it’s own issues.
And not all forms of validity are relevant to all studies. I’m going to talk about ﬁve diﬀerent types
of validity:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">Internal validity

      <li class="itemize">External validity

      <li class="itemize">Face validity
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Ecological validity</li></ul>
<!--l. 306--><p class="indent" >   First, a quick guide as to what matters here. (1) Internal and external validity are the most
important, since they tie directly to the fundamental question of whether your study really works.
(2) Construct validity asks whether you’re measuring what you think you are. (3) Face validity isn’t
terribly important except insofar as you care about “appearances”. (4) Ecological validity is a
special case of face validity that corresponds to a kind of appearance that you might care about a
lot.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.6.1   </span> <a 
 id="x10-270002.6.1"></a>Internal validity</h4>
<!--l. 310--><p class="noindent" ><span id="textcolor42">Internal validity</span> refers to the extent to which you are able draw the correct conclusions about the
causal relationships between variables. It’s called “internal” because it refers to the relationships
between things “inside” the study. Let’s illustrate the concept with a simple example. Suppose
you’re interested in ﬁnding out whether a university education makes you write better. To do so,
you get a group of ﬁrst year students, ask them to write a 1000 word essay, and count the number
of spelling and grammatical errors they make. Then you ﬁnd some third-year students,
who obviously have had more of a university education than the ﬁrst-years, and repeat
the exercise. And let’s suppose it turns out that the third-year students produce fewer
errors. And so you conclude that a university education improves writing skills. Right?
Except that the big problem with this experiment is that the third-year students are
older and they’ve had more experience with writing things. So it’s hard to know for
sure what the causal relationship is. Do older people write better? Or people who have
had more writing experience? Or people who have had more education? Which of the
above is the true cause of the superior performance of the third-years? Age? Experience?
Education? You can’t tell. This is an example of a failure of internal validity, because
your study doesn’t properly tease apart the causal relationships between the diﬀerent
variables.

what extent do you expect to see the same pattern of results in “real life” as you saw in your study.
To put it a bit more precisely, any study that you do in psychology will involve a fairly
speciﬁc set of questions or tasks, will occur in a speciﬁc environment, and will involve
participants that are drawn from a particular subgroup (disappointingly often it is college
students!). So, if it turns out that the results don’t actually generalise or apply to people and
situations beyond the ones that you studied, then what you’ve got is a lack of external
validity.
</p><!--l. 316--><p class="indent" >   The classic example of this issue is the fact that a very large proportion of studies in psychology
will use undergraduate psychology students as the participants. Obviously, however, the researchers
don’t care only about psychology students. They care about people in general. Given that, a study
that uses only psychology students as participants always carries a risk of lacking external validity.
That is, if there’s something “special” about psychology students that makes them diﬀerent to the
general population in some relevant respect, then we may start worrying about a lack of external
validity.
</p><!--l. 318--><p class="indent" >   That said, it is absolutely critical to realise that a study that uses only psychology students
does not necessarily have a problem with external validity. I’ll talk about this again later, but
it’s such a common mistake that I’m going to mention it here. The external validity
of a study is threatened by the choice of population if (a) the population from which
you sample your participants is very narrow (e.g., psychology students), and (b) the
narrow population that you sampled from is systematically diﬀerent from the general
population in some respect that is relevant to the psychological phenomenon that you intend to
study. The italicised part is the bit that lots of people forget. It is true that psychology
undergraduates diﬀer from the general population in lots of ways, and so a study that uses
only psychology students may have problems with external validity. However, if those
diﬀerences aren’t very relevant to the phenomenon that you’re studying, then there’s
nothing to worry about. To make this a bit more concrete here are two extreme examples:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">You want to measure “attitudes of the general public towards psychotherapy”, but all
      of your participants are psychology students. This study would almost certainly have
      a problem with external validity.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">You want to measure the eﬀectiveness of a visual illusion, and your participants are all
      psychology students. This study is unlikely to have a problem with external validity</li></ul>
<!--l. 324--><p class="indent" >   Having just spent the last couple of paragraphs focusing on the choice of participants, since
that’s a big issue that everyone tends to worry most about, it’s worth remembering that
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
external validity is a broader concept. The following are also examples of things that
might pose a threat to external validity, depending on what kind of study you’re doing:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">People might answer a “psychology questionnaire” in a manner that doesn’t reﬂect
      what they would do in real life.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Your lab experiment on (say) “human learning” has a diﬀerent structure to the learning
      problems people face in real life.</li></ul>

 id="x10-290002.6.3"></a>Construct validity</h4>
<!--l. 333--><p class="noindent" ><span id="textcolor46">Construct validity</span> is basically a question of whether you’re measuring what you want to be
measuring. A measurement has good construct validity if it is actually measuring the correct
theoretical construct, and bad construct validity if it doesn’t. To give a very simple (if ridiculous)
example, suppose I’m trying to investigate the rates with which university students cheat on their
exams. And the way I attempt to measure it is by asking the cheating students to stand up in the
lecture theatre so that I can count them. When I do this with a class of 300 students 0 people claim
to be cheaters. So I therefore conclude that the proportion of cheaters in my class is
0%. Clearly this is a bit ridiculous. But the point here is not that this is a very deep
methodological example, but rather to explain what construct validity is. The problem with my
measure is that while I’m trying to measure “the proportion of people who cheat” what I’m
actually measuring is “the proportion of people stupid enough to own up to cheating,
or bloody minded enough to pretend that they do”. Obviously, these aren’t the same
thing! So my study has gone wrong, because my measurement has very poor construct
validity.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.6.4   </span> <a 
 id="x10-300002.6.4"></a>Face validity</h4>
<!--l. 337--><p class="noindent" ><span id="textcolor47">Face validity</span> simply refers to whether or not a measure “looks like” it’s doing what it’s supposed
to, nothing more. If I design a test of intelligence, and people look at it and they say “no, that test
doesn’t measure intelligence”, then the measure lacks face validity. It’s as simple as that. Obviously,
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
face validity isn’t very important from a pure scientiﬁc perspective. After all, what we care about is
whether or not the measure actually does what it’s supposed to do, not whether it looks like it does
what it’s supposed to do. As a consequence, we generally don’t care very much about face
validity. That said, the concept of face validity serves three useful pragmatic purposes:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">Sometimes, an experienced scientist will have a “hunch” that a particular measure
      won’t work. While these sorts of hunches have no strict evidentiary value, it’s often
      worth paying attention to them. Because often times people have knowledge that they
      can’t quite verbalise, so there might be something to worry about even if you can’t
      quite say why. In other words, when someone you trust criticises the face validity of
      your study, it’s worth taking the time to think more carefully about your design to see
      if you can think of reasons why it might go awry. Mind you, if you don’t ﬁnd any reason
      for concern, then you should probably not worry. After all, face validity really doesn’t
      matter very much.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Often (very often), completely uninformed people will also have a “hunch” that your
      research is crap. And they’ll criticise it on the internet or something. On close inspection
      you may notice that these criticisms are actually focused entirely on how the study
      “looks”, but not on anything deeper. The concept of face validity is useful for gently
      explaining to people that they need to substantiate their arguments further.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Expanding on the last point, if the beliefs of untrained people are critical (e.g., this is
      often the case for applied research where you actually want to convince policy makers of
      something or other) then you have to care about face validity. Simply because, whether
      you like it or not, a lot of people will use face validity as a proxy for real validity. If
      you want the government to change a law on scientiﬁc psychological grounds, then it
      won’t matter how good your studies “really” are. If they lack face validity you’ll ﬁnd
      that politicians ignore you. Of course, it’s somewhat unfair that policy often depends
      more on appearance than fact, but that’s how things go.</li></ul>

<!--l. 346--><p class="noindent" ><span id="textcolor48">Ecological validity</span> is a diﬀerent notion of validity, which is similar to external validity, but less
important. The idea is that, in order to be ecologically valid, the entire set up of the study
should closely approximate the real world scenario that is being investigated. In a sense,
ecological validity is a kind of face validity. It relates mostly to whether the study “looks”
right, but with a bit more rigour to it. To be ecologically valid the study has to look
right in a fairly speciﬁc way. The idea behind it is the intuition that a study that is
ecologically valid is more likely to be externally valid. It’s no guarantee, of course. But the
nice thing about ecological validity is that it’s much easier to check whether a study
is ecologically valid than it is to check whether a study is externally valid. A simple
example would be eyewitness identiﬁcation studies. Most of these studies tend to be
done in a university setting, often with a fairly simple array of faces to look at, rather
than a line up. The length of time between seeing the “criminal” and being asked to
identify the suspect in the “line up” is usually shorter. The “crime” isn’t real so there’s no
chance of the witness being scared, and there are no police oﬃcers present so there’s not
as much chance of feeling pressured. These things all mean that the study deﬁnitely
lacks ecological validity. They might (but might not) mean that it also lacks external
validity.

<!--l. 351--><p class="noindent" >If we look at the issue of validity in the most general fashion the two biggest worries that
we have are confounders and artefacts. These two terms are deﬁned in the following
way:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize"><span id="textcolor49">Confounder</span>: A confounder is an additional, often unmeasured variable<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x10-32001f6"></a> 
      that turns out to be related to both the predictors and the outcome. The existence of
      confounders threatens the internal validity of the study because you can’t tell whether
      the predictor causes the outcome, or if the confounding variable causes it.
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span id="textcolor51">Artefact</span>: A result is said to be “artefactual” if it only holds in the special situation
      that you happened to test in your study. The possibility that your result is an artefact
      describes a threat to your external validity, because it raises the possibility that you
      can’t generalise or apply your results to the actual population that you care about.</li></ul>
<!--l. 358--><p class="indent" >   As a general rule confounders are a bigger concern for non-experimental studies, precisely
because they’re not proper experiments. By deﬁnition, you’re leaving lots of things uncontrolled, so
there’s a lot of scope for confounders being present in your study. Experimental research tends to
be much less vulnerable to confounders. The more control you have over what happens during the
study, the more you can prevent confounders from aﬀecting the results. With random
allocation, for example, confounders are distributed randomly, and evenly, between diﬀerent
groups.
</p><!--l. 360--><p class="indent" >   However, there are always swings and roundabouts and when we start thinking about artefacts
rather than confounders the shoe is very ﬁrmly on the other foot. For the most part, artefactual
results tend to be a concern for experimental studies than for non-experimental studies. To see this,
it helps to realise that the reason that a lot of studies are non-experimental is precisely because
what the researcher is trying to do is examine human behaviour in a more naturalistic context. By
working in a more real-world context you lose experimental control (making yourself vulnerable to
confounders), but because you tend to be studying human psychology “in the wild” you reduce the
chances of getting an artefactual result. Or, to put it another way, when you take psychology out of
the wild and bring it into the lab (which we usually have to do to gain our experimental control),
you always run the risk of accidentally studying something diﬀerent to what you wanted to
study.
</p><!--l. 362--><p class="indent" >   Be warned though. The above is a rough guide only. It’s absolutely possible to have confounders
in an experiment, and to get artefactual results with non-experimental studies. This can happen for
all sorts of reasons, not least of which is experimenter or researcher error. In practice, it’s really
hard to think everything through ahead of time and even very good researchers make
mistakes.
</p><!--l. 364--><p class="indent" >   Although there’s a sense in which almost any threat to validity can be characterised as a
confounder or an artefact, they’re pretty vague concepts. So let’s have a look at some of the most
common examples.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.7.1   </span> <a

<!--l. 368--><p class="noindent" ><span id="textcolor52">History eﬀects</span> refer to the possibility that speciﬁc events may occur during the study
that might inﬂuence the outcome measure. For instance, something might happen in
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
between a pre-test and a post-test. Or in-between testing participant 23 and participant
24. Alternatively, it might be that you’re looking at a paper from an older study that
was perfectly valid for its time, but the world has changed enough since then that the
conclusions are no longer trustworthy. Examples of things that would count as history eﬀects
are:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">You’re interested in how people think about risk and uncertainty. You started your
      data collection in December 2010. But ﬁnding participants and collecting data takes
      time, so you’re still ﬁnding new people in February 2011. Unfortunately for you (and
      even more unfortunately for others), the Queensland ﬂoods occurred in January 2011
      causing billions of dollars of damage and killing many people. Not surprisingly, the
      people tested in February 2011 express quite diﬀerent beliefs about handling risk than
      the people tested in December 2010. Which (if any) of these reﬂects the “true” beliefs
      of participants? I think the answer is probably both. The Queensland ﬂoods genuinely
      changed the beliefs of the Australian public, though possibly only temporarily. The key
      thing here is that the “history” of the people tested in February is quite diﬀerent to
      people tested in December.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">You’re testing the psychological eﬀects of a new anti-anxiety drug. So what you do
      is  measure  anxiety  before  administering  the  drug  (e.g.,  by  self-report,  and  taking
      physiological measures). Then you administer the drug, and afterwards you take the
      same measures. In the middle however, because your lab is in Los Angeles, there’s an
      earthquake which increases the anxiety of the participants.</li></ul>

<!--l. 377--><p class="noindent" >As with history eﬀects, <span id="textcolor53">maturational eﬀects</span> are fundamentally about change over time. However,
maturation eﬀects aren’t in response to speciﬁc events. Rather, they relate to how people change on
their own over time. We get older, we get tired, we get bored, etc. Some examples of maturation
eﬀects are:
</p>
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">When doing developmental psychology research you need to be aware that children
      grow up quite rapidly. So, suppose that you want to ﬁnd out whether some educational
      trick helps with vocabulary size among 3 year olds. One thing that you need to be
      aware of is that the vocabulary size of children that age is growing at an incredible
      rate (multiple words per day) all on its own. If you design your study without taking
      this maturational eﬀect into account, then you won’t be able to tell if your educational
      trick works.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">When running a very long experiment in the lab (say, something that goes for 3 hours)

measurements of some psychological construct (e.g., anxiety). One thing I might be
worried about is if the ﬁrst measurement has an eﬀect on the second measurement.
In other words, this is a history eﬀect in which the “event” that inﬂuences the second
measurement is the ﬁrst measurement itself! This is not at all uncommon. Examples of this
include:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">Learning  and  practice:  e.g.,  “intelligence”  at  time  2  might  appear  to  go  up

<!--l. 396--><p class="noindent" ><span id="textcolor55">Selection bias</span> is a pretty broad term. Suppose that you’re running an experiment with two
groups of participants where each group gets a diﬀerent “treatment”, and you want to see if the
diﬀerent treatments lead to diﬀerent outcomes. However, suppose that, despite your best eﬀorts,
you’ve ended up with a gender imbalance across groups (say, group A has 80% females and
group B has 50% females). It might sound like this could never happen but, trust me,
it can. This is an example of a selection bias, in which the people “selected into” the
two groups have diﬀerent characteristics. If any of those characteristics turns out to be
relevant (say, your treatment works better on females than males) then you’re in a lot of
trouble.

<!--l. 400--><p class="noindent" >When thinking about the eﬀects of attrition, it is sometimes helpful to distinguish between two
diﬀerent types. The ﬁrst is <span id="textcolor56">homogeneous attrition</span>, in which the attrition eﬀect is the same for
all groups, treatments or conditions. In the example I gave above, the attrition would be
homogeneous if (and only if) the easily bored participants are dropping out of all of the conditions
in my experiment at about the same rate. In general, the main eﬀect of homogeneous attrition is
likely to be that it makes your sample unrepresentative. As such, the biggest worry that you’ll have
is that the generalisability of the results decreases. In other words, you lose external
validity.
</p><!--l. 402--><p class="indent" >   The second type of attrition is <span id="textcolor57">heterogeneous attrition</span>, in which the attrition eﬀect is
diﬀerent for diﬀerent groups. More often called <span id="textcolor58">diﬀerential attrition</span>, this is a kind of selection
bias that is caused by the study itself. Suppose that, for the ﬁrst time ever in the history
of psychology, I manage to ﬁnd the perfectly balanced and representative sample of
people. I start running “Dani’s incredibly long and tedious experiment” on my perfect
sample but then, because my study is incredibly long and tedious, lots of people start
dropping out. I can’t stop this. Participants absolutely have the right to stop doing
any experiment, any time, for whatever reason they feel like, and as researchers we are
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
morally (and professionally) obliged to remind people that they do have this right. So,
suppose that “Dani’s incredibly long and tedious experiment” has a very high drop out
rate. What do you suppose the odds are that this drop out is random? Answer: zero.
Almost certainly the people who remain are more conscientious, more tolerant of boredom,
etc., than those that leave. To the extent that (say) conscientiousness is relevant to the
psychological phenomenon that I care about, this attrition can decrease the validity of my
results.
</p><!--l. 404--><p class="indent" >   Here’s another example. Suppose I design my experiment with two conditions. In the
“treatment” condition, the experimenter insults the participant and then gives them a
questionnaire designed to measure obedience. In the “control” condition, the experimenter engages
in a bit of pointless chitchat and then gives them the questionnaire. Leaving aside the
questionable scientiﬁc merits and dubious ethics of such a study, let’s have a think about
what might go wrong here. As a general rule, when someone insults me to my face I
tend to get much less co-operative. So, there’s a pretty good chance that a lot more
people are going to drop out of the treatment condition than the control condition.
And this drop out isn’t going to be random. The people most likely to drop out would
probably be the people who don’t care all that much about the importance of obediently
sitting through the experiment. Since the most bloody minded and disobedient people
all left the treatment group but not the control group, we’ve introduced a confound:
the people who actually took the questionnaire in the treatment group were already
more likely to be dutiful and obedient than the people in the control group. In short,
in this study insulting people doesn’t make them more obedient. It makes the more
disobedient people leave the experiment! The internal validity of this experiment is completely
shot.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.7.6   </span> <a

<!--l. 408--><p class="noindent" ><span id="textcolor59">Non-response bias</span> is closely related to selection bias and to diﬀerential attrition. The simplest
version of the problem goes like this. You mail out a survey to 1000 people but only 300 of them
reply. The 300 people who replied are almost certainly not a random subsample. People who
respond to surveys are systematically diﬀerent to people who don’t. This introduces a problem
when trying to generalise from those 300 people who replied to the population at large, since you
now have a very non-random sample. The issue of non-response bias is more general than this,
though. Among the (say) 300 people that did respond to the survey, you might ﬁnd that not
everyone answers every question. If (say) 80 people chose not to answer one of your questions,
does this introduce problems? As always, the answer is maybe. If the question that
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
wasn’t answered was on the last page of the questionnaire, and those 80 surveys were
returned with the last page missing, there’s a good chance that the missing data isn’t a big
deal; probably the pages just fell oﬀ. However, if the question that 80 people didn’t
answer was the most confrontational or invasive personal question in the questionnaire,
then almost certainly you’ve got a problem. In essence, what you’re dealing with here
is what’s called the problem of <span id="textcolor60">missing data</span>. If the data that is missing was “lost”
randomly, then it’s not a big problem. If it’s missing systematically, then it can be a big
problem.

eﬀect on very smart kids. To do this, I ﬁnd the 20 psychology I students with the best high school
grades and look at how well they’re doing at university. It turns out that they’re doing a
lot better than average, but they’re not topping the class at university even though
they did top their classes at high school. What’s going on? The natural ﬁrst thought
is that this must mean that the psychology classes must be having an adverse eﬀect
on those students. However, while that might very well be the explanation, it’s more
likely that what you’re seeing is an example of “regression to the mean”. To see how it
works, let’s take a moment to think about what is required to get the best mark in a
class, regardless of whether that class be at high school or at university. When you’ve
got a big class there are going to be lots of very smart people enrolled. To get the best
mark you have to be very smart, work very hard, and be a bit lucky. The exam has to
ask just the right questions for your idiosyncratic skills, and you have to avoid making
any dumb mistakes (we all do that sometimes) when answering them. And that’s the
thing, whilst intelligence and hard work are transferable from one class to the next, luck
isn’t. The people who got lucky in high school won’t be the same as the people who
get lucky at university. That’s the very deﬁnition of “luck”. The consequence of this is
that when you select people at the very extreme values of one measurement (the top 20
students), you’re selecting for hard work, skill and luck. But because the luck doesn’t
transfer to the second measurement (only the skill and work), these people will all be
expected to drop a little bit when you measure them a second time (at university). So
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
their scores fall back a little bit, back towards everyone else. This is regression to the
mean.
</p><!--l. 416--><p class="indent" >   Regression to the mean is surprisingly common. For instance, if two very tall people have kids
their children will tend to be taller than average but not as tall as the parents. The reverse happens
with very short parents. Two very short parents will tend to have short children, but nevertheless
those kids will tend to be taller than the parents. It can also be extremely subtle. For instance,
there have been studies done that suggested that people learn better from negative feedback than
from positive feedback. However, the way that people tried to show this was to give people positive
reinforcement whenever they did good, and negative reinforcement when they did bad. And what
you see is that after the positive reinforcement people tended to do worse, but after the
negative reinforcement they tended to do better. But notice that there’s a selection bias
here! When people do very well, you’re selecting for “high” values, and so you should
expect, because of regression to the mean, that performance on the next trial should be
worse regardless of whether reinforcement is given. Similarly, after a bad trial, people
will tend to improve all on their own. The apparent superiority of negative feedback is
an artefact caused by regression to the mean (see Kahneman and Tversky 1973, for
discussion).

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.7.8   </span> <a 
 id="x10-400002.7.8"></a>Experimenter bias</h4>
<!--l. 420--><p class="noindent" ><span id="textcolor62">Experimenter bias</span> can come in multiple forms. The basic idea is that the experimenter, despite
the best of intentions, can accidentally end up inﬂuencing the results of the experiment by
subtly communicating the “right answer” or the “desired behaviour” to the participants.
Typically, this occurs because the experimenter has special knowledge that the participant
does not, for example the right answer to the questions being asked or knowledge of
the expected pattern of performance for the condition that the participant is in. The
classic example of this happening is the case study of “Clever Hans”, which dates back to
1907 (Pfungst 1911; Hothersall 2004). Clever Hans was a horse that apparently was
able to read and count and perform other human like feats of intelligence. After Clever
Hans became famous, psychologists started examining his behaviour more closely. It
turned out that, not surprisingly, Hans didn’t know how to do maths. Rather, Hans
was responding to the human observers around him, because the humans did know
how to count and the horse had learned to change its behaviour when people changed
theirs.
</p><!--l. 422--><p class="indent" >   The general solution to the problem of experimenter bias is to engage in double blind studies,
where neither the experimenter nor the participant knows which condition the participant is in or
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
knows what the desired behaviour is. This provides a very good solution to the problem, but it’s
important to recognise that it’s not quite ideal, and hard to pull oﬀ perfectly. For instance, the
obvious way that I could try to construct a double blind study is to have one of my Ph.D. students
(one who doesn’t know anything about the experiment) run the study. That feels like it should
be enough. The only person (me) who knows all the details (e.g., correct answers to
the questions, assignments of participants to conditions) has no interaction with the
participants, and the person who does all the talking to people (the Ph.D. student)
doesn’t know anything. Except for the reality that the last part is very unlikely to be
true. In order for the Ph.D. student to run the study eﬀectively they need to have been
briefed by me, the researcher. And, as it happens, the Ph.D. student also knows me and
knows a bit about my general beliefs about people and psychology (e.g., I tend to think
humans are much smarter than psychologists give them credit for). As a result of all this,
it’s almost impossible for the experimenter to avoid knowing a little bit about what
expectations I have. And even a little bit of knowledge can have an eﬀect. Suppose the
experimenter accidentally conveys the fact that the participants are expected to do well
in this task. Well, there’s a thing called the “Pygmalion eﬀect”, where if you expect
great things of people they’ll tend to rise to the occasion. But if you expect them to
fail then they’ll do that too. In other words, the expectations become a self-fulﬁlling
prophesy.

<!--l. 428--><p class="noindent" >When talking about experimenter bias, the worry is that the experimenter’s knowledge or desires
for the experiment are communicated to the participants, and that these can change people’s
behaviour (Rosenthal 1966). However, even if you manage to stop this from happening,
it’s almost impossible to stop people from knowing that they’re part of a psychological
study. And the mere fact of knowing that someone is watching or studying you can
have a pretty big eﬀect on behaviour. This is generally referred to as <span id="textcolor63">reactivity</span> or
<span id="textcolor64">demand eﬀects</span>. The basic idea is captured by the Hawthorne eﬀect: people alter their
performance because of the attention that the study focuses on them. The eﬀect takes
its name from a study that took place in the “Hawthorne Works” factory outside of
Chicago (see Adair 1984). This study, from the 1920s, looked at the eﬀects of factory
lighting on worker productivity. But, importantly, change in worker behaviour occurred
because the workers knew they were being studied, rather than any eﬀect of factory
lighting.

<!--l. 447--><p class="noindent" >The <span id="textcolor65">placebo eﬀect</span> is a speciﬁc type of demand eﬀect that we worry a lot about. It refers to the
situation where the mere fact of being treated causes an improvement in outcomes. The classic
example comes from clinical trials. If you give people a completely chemically inert drug and tell
them that it’s a cure for a disease, they will tend to get better faster than people who aren’t
treated at all. In other words, it is people’s belief that they are being treated that causes the
improved outcomes, not the drug.
</p><!--l. 449--><p class="indent" >   However, the current consensus in medicine is that true placebo eﬀects are quite rare and most
of what was previously considered placebo eﬀect is in fact some combination of natural healing
(some people just get better on their own), regression to the mean and other quirks of study design.
Of interest to psychology is that the strongest evidence for at least some placebo eﬀect is in
self-reported outcomes, most notably in treatment of pain (Hróbjartsson and Gøtzsche
2010).

While the vast majority of scientists are honest, in my experience at least, some are
not.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x10-44001f7"></a> 
Not only that, as I mentioned earlier, scientists are not immune to belief bias. It’s easy for a
researcher to end up deceiving themselves into believing the wrong thing, and this can lead
them to conduct subtly ﬂawed research and then hide those ﬂaws when they write it up.
So you need to consider not only the (probably unlikely) possibility of outright fraud,
but also the (probably quite common) possibility that the research is unintentionally
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
“slanted”. I opened a few standard textbooks and didn’t ﬁnd much of a discussion of
this problem, so here’s my own attempt to list a few ways in which these issues can
arise:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize"><span id="textcolor67">Data fabrication</span>. Sometimes, people just make up the data. This is occasionally done
      with “good” intentions. For instance, the researcher believes that the fabricated data do
      reﬂect the truth, and may actually reﬂect “slightly cleaned up” versions of actual data.
      On other occasions, the fraud is deliberate and malicious. Some high-proﬁle examples
      where data fabrication has been alleged or shown include Cyril Burt (a psychologist
      who is thought to have fabricated some of his data), Andrew Wakeﬁeld (who has been
      accused of fabricating his data connecting the MMR vaccine to autism) and Hwang
      Woo-suk (who falsiﬁed a lot of his data on stem cell research).
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span id="textcolor68">Hoaxes</span>. Hoaxes share a lot of similarities with data fabrication, but they diﬀer in
      the intended purpose. A hoax is often a joke, and many of them are intended to be
      (eventually) discovered. Often, the point of a hoax is to discredit someone or some
      ﬁeld. There’s quite a few well known scientiﬁc hoaxes that have occurred over the years
      (e.g., Piltdown man) and some were deliberate attempts to discredit particular ﬁelds
      of research (e.g., the Sokal aﬀair).
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span id="textcolor69">Data misrepresentation</span>. While fraud gets most of the headlines, it’s much more
      common in my experience to see data being misrepresented. When I say this I’m not
      referring to newspapers getting it wrong (which they do, almost always). I’m referring
      to the fact that often the data don’t actually say what the researchers think they say.
      My guess is that, almost always, this isn’t the result of deliberate dishonesty but instead
      is due to a lack of sophistication in the data analyses. For instance, think back to the
      example of Simpson’s paradox that I discussed in the beginning of this book. It’s very
      common to see people present “aggregated” data of some kind and sometimes, when
      you dig deeper and ﬁnd the raw data yourself you ﬁnd that the aggregated data tell a
      diﬀerent story to the disaggregated data. Alternatively, you might ﬁnd that some aspect
      of the data is being hidden, because it tells an inconvenient story (e.g., the researcher
      might choose not to refer to a particular variable). There’s a lot of variants on this,
      many of which are very hard to detect.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span id="textcolor70">Study  “misdesign”</span>.  Okay,  this  one  is  subtle.  Basically,  the  issue  here  is  that  a
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
      researcher designs a study that has built-in ﬂaws and those ﬂaws are never reported in
      the paper. The data that are reported are completely real and are correctly analysed,
      but they are produced by a study that is actually quite wrongly put together. The
      researcher really wants to ﬁnd a particular eﬀect and so the study is set up in such
      a way as to make it “easy” to (artefactually) observe that eﬀect. One sneaky way to
      do this, in case you’re feeling like dabbling in a bit of fraud yourself, is to design an
      experiment in which it’s obvious to the participants what they’re “supposed” to be
      doing, and then let reactivity work its magic for you. If you want you can add all
      the trappings of double blind experimentation but it won’t make a diﬀerence since the
      study materials themselves are subtly telling people what you want them to do. When
      you write up the results the fraud won’t be obvious to the reader. What’s obvious to
      the participant when they’re in the experimental context isn’t always obvious to the
      person reading the paper. Of course, the way I’ve described this makes it sound like
      it’s always fraud. Probably there are cases where this is done deliberately, but in my
      experience the bigger concern has been with unintentional misdesign. The researcher
      believes and so the study just happens to end up with a built in ﬂaw, and that ﬂaw
      then magically erases itself when the study is written up for publication.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span id="textcolor71">Data mining &#x0026; post hoc hypothesising</span>. Another way in which the authors of a
      study can more or less misrepresent the data is by engaging in what’s referred to as
      “data mining” (see Gelman and Loken 2014, for a broader discussion of this as part of
      the “garden of forking paths” in statistical analysis). As we’ll discuss later, if you keep
      trying to analyse your data in lots of diﬀerent ways, you’ll eventually ﬁnd something
      that “looks” like a real eﬀect but isn’t. This is referred to as “data mining”. It used
      to be quite rare because data analysis used to take weeks, but now that everyone has
      very powerful statistical software on their computers it’s becoming very common. Data
      mining per se isn’t “wrong”, but the more that you do it the bigger the risk you’re
      taking. The thing that is wrong, and I suspect is very common, is unacknowledged
      data mining. That is, the researcher runs every possible analysis known to humanity,
      ﬁnds the one that works, and then pretends that this was the only analysis that they
      ever conducted. Worse yet, they often “invent” a hypothesis after looking at the data
      to cover up the data mining. To be clear. It’s not wrong to change your beliefs after
      looking at the data, and to reanalyse your data using your new “post hoc” hypotheses.
      What is wrong (and I suspect common) is failing to acknowledge that you’ve done. If
      you acknowledge that you did it then other researchers are able to take your behaviour
      into account. If you don’t, then they can’t. And that makes your behaviour deceptive.
      Bad!
      </li>
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
      <li class="itemize"><span id="textcolor72">Publication bias &#x0026; self-censoring</span>. Finally, a pervasive bias is “non-reporting” of
      negative results. This is almost impossible to prevent. Journals don’t publish every
      article that is submitted to them. They prefer to publish articles that ﬁnd “something”.
      So, if 20 people run an experiment looking at whether reading Finnegans Wake causes
      insanity in humans, and 19 of them ﬁnd that it doesn’t, which one do you think is going
      to get published? Obviously, it’s the one study that did ﬁnd that Finnegans Wake causes
      insanity.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="lsj18.html#fn8x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">8</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x10-44002f8"></a> 
      This is an example of a publication bias. Since no-one ever published the 19 studies that
      didn’t ﬁnd an eﬀect, a naive reader would never know that they existed. Worse yet, most
      researchers “internalise” this bias and end up self-censoring their research. Knowing
      that negative results aren’t going to be accepted for publication, they never even try to
      report them. As a friend of mine says “for every experiment that you get published, you
      also have 10 failures”. And she’s right. The catch is, while some (maybe most) of those
      studies are failures for boring reasons (e.g. you stuﬀed something up) others might be
      genuine “null” results that you ought to acknowledge when you write up the “good”
      experiment. And telling which is which is often hard to do. A good place to start is
      a paper by Ioannidis (2005) with the depressing title “Why most published research
      ﬁndings are false”. I’d also suggest taking a look at work by Kühberger, Fritz, and
      Scherndl (2014) presenting statistical evidence that this actually happens in psychology.</li></ul>
<!--l. 473--><p class="indent" >   There’s probably a lot more issues like this to think about, but that’ll do to start with. What I
