   of hypotheses than those that I’m mentioning here. Very brieﬂy, notice that the nested model M1
   corresponds to the full model M2 when we constrain some of the regression coeﬃcients to zero. It
   is sometimes useful to construct sub-models by placing other kinds of constraints on the regression
   coeﬃcients. For instance, maybe two diﬀerent coeﬃcients might have to sum to zero, or something like
   that. You can construct hypothesis tests for those kind of constraints too, but it is somewhat more
   complicated and the sampling distribution for F can end up being something known as the non-central F
   distribution, which is waaaaay beyond the scope of this book! All I want to do is alert you to this
   possibility.</span></p></div>
