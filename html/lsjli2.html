<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent" >Part IV of the book is by far the most theoretical, focusing as it does on the theory of statistical
inference. Over the next three chapters my goal is to give you an introduction to probability theory
(Chapter <a 
href="lsjch7.html#x53-1160007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: ch:probability --></a>), sampling and estimation (Chapter <a 
href="lsjch8.html#x58-1300008">8<!--tex4ht:ref: ch:estimation --></a>) and statistical hypothesis testing (Chapter <a 
href="lsjch9.html#x67-1500009">9<!--tex4ht:ref: ch:hypothesistesting --></a>).
Before we get started though, I want to say something about the big picture. Statistical inference is
primarily about learning from data. The goal is no longer merely to describe our data
but to use the data to draw conclusions about the world. To motivate the discussion I
want to spend a bit of time talking about a philosophical puzzle known as the riddle of
induction, because it speaks to an issue that will pop up over and over again throughout
the book: statistical inference relies on assumptions. This sounds like a bad thing. In
everyday life people say things like “you should never make assumptions”, and psychology
classes often talk about assumptions and biases as bad things that we should try to
avoid. From bitter personal experience I have learned never to say such things around
philosophers!

He and his companion, J. W. Croker, were playing a guessing game, each trying to predict what
would be on the other side of each hill. In every case it turned out that Wellesley was right and
Croker was wrong. Many years later when Wellesley was asked about the game he explained that
“the whole art of war consists in getting at what is on the other side of the hill”. Indeed, war is not
special in this respect. All of life is a guessing game of one form or another, and getting by on a day
to day basis requires us to make good guesses. So let’s play a guessing game of our
own.

 id="x51-115000IV"></a>Learning without making assumptions is a myth</h3>
<!--l. 94--><p class="noindent" >There are lots of diﬀerent ways in which we could dissect this dialogue, but since this is
a statistics book pitched at psychologists and not an introduction to the philosophy
and psychology of reasoning, I’ll keep it brief. What I’ve described above is sometimes
referred to as the riddle of induction. It seems entirely reasonable to think that a 12-0
winning record by Wellesley is pretty strong evidence that he will win the 13th game, but
it is not easy to provide a proper logical justiﬁcation for this belief. On the contrary,
despite the obviousness of the answer, it’s not actually possible to justify betting on
Wellesley without relying on some assumption that you don’t have any logical justiﬁcation
for.
</p><!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   The riddle of induction is most associated with the philosophical work of David Hume and more
recently Nelson Goodman, but you can ﬁnd examples of the problem popping up in
ﬁelds as diverse as literature (Lewis Carroll) and machine learning (the “no free lunch”
theorem). There really is something weird about trying to “learn what we do not know from
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
what we do know”. The critical point is that assumptions and biases are unavoidable if
you want to learn anything about the world. There is no escape from this, and it is
just as true for statistical inference as it is for human reasoning. In the dialogue I was
taking aim at your perfectly sensible inferences as a human being, but the common sense
reasoning that you relied on is no diﬀerent to what a statistician would have done. Your
“common sense” half of the dialog relied on an implicit assumption that there exists some
diﬀerence in skill between Wellesley and Croker, and what you were doing was trying
to work out what that diﬀerence in skill level would be. My “logical analysis” rejects
that assumption entirely. All I was willing to accept is that there are sequences of wins
and losses and that I did not know which sequences would be observed. Throughout
the dialogue I kept insisting that all logically possible data sets were equally plausible
at the start of the Wellesely-Croker game, and the only way in which I ever revised
my beliefs was to eliminate those possibilities that were factually inconsistent with the
observations.
</p><!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   That sounds perfectly sensible on its own terms. In fact, it even sounds like the hallmark of
good deductive reasoning. Like Sherlock Holmes, my approach was to rule out that which is
impossible in the hope that what would be left is the truth. Yet as we saw, ruling out the
impossible never led me to make a prediction. On its own terms everything I said in my half of the
dialogue was entirely correct. An inability to make any predictions is the logical consequence of
making “no assumptions”. In the end I lost our game because you did make some assumptions and
those assumptions turned out to be right. Skill is a real thing, and because you believed in the
existence of skill you were able to learn that Wellesley had more of it than Croker. Had you
relied on a less sensible assumption to drive your learning you might not have won the
game.
</p><!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >   Ultimately there are two things you should take away from this. First, as I’ve said, you cannot
avoid making assumptions if you want to learn anything from your data. But second, once you
realise that assumptions are necessary it becomes important to make sure you make the right ones!
A data analysis that relies on few assumptions is not necessarily better than one that makes many
assumptions, it all depends on whether those assumptions are good ones for your data. As we
go through the rest of this book I’ll often point out the assumptions that underpin a
particular statistical technique, and how you can check whether those assumptions are
sensible.
