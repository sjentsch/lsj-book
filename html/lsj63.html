  I’m being here. You can’t just compare IQ scores in Whyalla to Port Pirie and assume that any diﬀerences are due to
  lead poisoning. Even if it were true that the only diﬀerences between the two towns corresponded to the diﬀerent
  reﬁneries (and it isn’t, not by a long shot), you need to account for the fact that people already believe
  that lead pollution causes cognitive deﬁcits. If you recall back to Chapter <a 
href="lsjch2.html#x10-100002">2<!--tex4ht:ref: ch:studydesign --></a>, this means that there
  are diﬀerent demand eﬀects for the Port Pirie sample than for the Whyalla sample. In other words,
  you might end up with an illusory group diﬀerence in your data, caused by the fact that people think
  that there is a real diﬀerence. I ﬁnd it pretty implausible to think that the locals wouldn’t be well
  aware of what you were trying to do if a bunch of researchers turned up in Port Pirie with lab coats
  and IQ tests, and even less plausible to think that a lot of people would be pretty resentful of you
  for doing it. Those people won’t be as co-operative in the tests. Other people in Port Pirie might be
  more motivated to do well because they don’t want their home town to look bad. The motivational
  eﬀects that would apply in Whyalla are likely to be weaker, because people don’t have any concept of
  “iron ore poisoning” in the same way that they have a concept for “lead poisoning”. Psychology is
  hard.</span></p></div>
