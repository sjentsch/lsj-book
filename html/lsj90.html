  technical report. Very typically, students are told that the “results” section of a report is for describing the data and
  reporting statistical analysis, and the “discussion” section is for providing interpretation. That’s true as far as it
  goes, but I think people often interpret it way too literally. The way I usually approach it is to provide a quick and
  simple interpretation of the data in the results section, so that my reader understands what the data are
  telling us. Then, in the discussion, I try to tell a bigger story about how my results ﬁt with the rest
  of the scientiﬁc literature. In short, don’t let the “interpretation goes in the discussion” advice turn
  your results section into incomprehensible garbage. Being understood by your reader is much more
  important.</span></p></div>
