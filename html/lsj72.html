  want to avoid is the word “prove”. A statistical test really doesn’t prove that a hypothesis is true
  or false. Proof implies certainty and, as the saying goes, statistics means never having to say you’re
  certain. On that point almost everyone would agree. However, beyond that there’s a fair amount of
  confusion. Some people argue that you’re only allowed to make statements like “rejected the null”, “failed
  to reject the null”, or possibly “retained the null”. According to this line of thinking you can’t say
  things like “accept the alternative” or “accept the null”. Personally I think this is too strong. In my
  opinion, this conﬂates null hypothesis testing with Karl Popper’s falsiﬁcationist view of the scientiﬁc
  process. Whilst there are similarities between falsiﬁcationism and null hypothesis testing, they aren’t
  equivalent. However, whilst I personally think it’s ﬁne to talk about accepting a hypothesis (on the
  proviso that “acceptance” doesn’t actually mean that it’s necessarily true, especially in the case of
  the null hypothesis), many people will disagree. And more to the point, you should be aware that
  this particular weirdness exists so that you’re not caught unawares by it when writing up your own
  results.</span></p></div>
