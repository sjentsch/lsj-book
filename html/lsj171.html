  problem is that the word “likelihood” has a very speciﬁc meaning in frequentist statistics, and it’s not quite the same
  as what it means in Bayesian statistics. As far as I can tell Bayesians didn’t originally have any agreed upon name
  for the likelihood, and so it became common practice for people to use the frequentist terminology. This wouldn’t
  have been a problem except for the fact that the way that Bayesians use the word turns out to be quite diﬀerent to
  the way frequentists do. This isn’t the place for yet another lengthy history lesson but, to put it crudely, when a
  Bayesian says “a likelihood function” they’re usually referring one of the rows of the table. When a frequentist says
  the same thing, they’re referring to the same table, but to them “a likelihood function” almost always
  refers to one of the columns. This distinction matters in some contexts, but it’s not important for our
  purposes.</span></p></div>
