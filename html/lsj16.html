  statistical tricks to deal with the confounder. Because of the existence of these statistical solutions to the problem of
  confounders, we often refer to a confounder that we have measured and dealt with as a covariate. Dealing with
  covariates is a more advanced topic, but I thought I’d mention it in passing since it’s kind of comforting to at least
  know that this stuﬀ exists.</span></p></div>
