 id="fn2x3">   <sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span>Well... now this is awkward, isn’t it? This section is one of the oldest parts of the book, and it’s
  outdated in a rather embarrassing way. I wrote this in 2010, at which point all of those facts were true.
  Revisiting this in 2018, well I’m not 33 any more, but that’s not surprising I suppose. I can’t imagine
  my chromosomes have changed, so I’m going to guess my karyotype was then and is now XY. The
  self-identiﬁed gender, on the other hand...ah. I suppose the fact that the title page now refers to me as
  Danielle rather than Daniel might possibly be a giveaway, but I don’t typically identify as “male” on a
  gender questionnaire these days, and I prefer “she/her” pronouns as a default (it’s a long story)! I did
  think a little about how I was going to handle this in the book, actually. The book has a somewhat
  distinct authorial voice to it, and I feel like it would be a rather diﬀerent work if I went back and wrote
  everything as Danielle and updated all the pronouns in the work. Besides, it would be a lot of work, so I’ve
  left my name as “Dan” throughout the book, and in any case “Dan” is a perfectly good nickname
  for “Danielle”, don’t you think? In any case, it’s not a big deal. I only wanted to mention it to make
  life a little easier for readers who aren’t sure how to refer to me. I still don’t like anchovies though
