  this case? Is it the set of students actually taking Dr Harpo’s class (all 33 of them)? The set of people who might
  take the class (an unknown number of them)? Or something else? Does it matter which of these we pick? It’s
  traditional in an introductory behavioural stats class to mumble a lot at this point, but since I get asked this
  question every year by my students, I’ll give a brief answer. Technically yes, it does matter. If you change your
  deﬁnition of what the “real world” population actually is, then the sampling distribution of your observed
  mean <span class="bar-css">X</span> changes too. The t-test relies on an assumption that the observations are sampled at random
  from an inﬁnitely large population and, to the extent that real life isn’t like that, then the t-test can
  be wrong. In practice, however, this isn’t usually a big deal. Even though the assumption is almost
  always wrong, it doesn’t lead to a lot of pathological behaviour from the test, so we tend to just ignore
  it.</span></p></div>
