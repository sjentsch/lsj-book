   For instance, I’ve completely ignored the diﬀerence between ﬁxed-eﬀect models in which the levels of a factor are
   “ﬁxed” by the experimenter or the world, and random-eﬀect models in which the levels are random samples from a
   larger population of possible levels (this book only covers ﬁxed-eﬀect models). Don’t make the mistake of thinking
   that this book, or any other one, will tell you “everything you need to know” about statistics, any more than a single
   book could possibly tell you everything you need to know about psychology, physics or philosophy. Life is too
   complicated for that to ever be true. This isn’t a cause for despair, though. Most researchers get by
   with a basic working knowledge of ANOVA that doesn’t go any further than this book does. I just
   want you to keep in mind that this book is only the beginning of a very long story, not the whole
   story.</span></p></div>
