<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent" >Visualising data is one of the most important tasks facing the data analyst. It’s important for two
distinct but closely related reasons. Firstly, there’s the matter of drawing “presentation graphics”,
displaying your data in a clean, visually appealing fashion makes it easier for your reader to
understand what you’re trying to tell them. Equally important, perhaps even more important, is
the fact that drawing graphs helps you to understand the data. To that end, it’s important to draw
“exploratory graphics” that help you learn about the data as you go about analysing it. These
points might seem pretty obvious but I cannot count the number of times I’ve seen people forget
them.
</p><!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >   To give a sense of the importance of this chapter, I want to start with a classic illustration of
just how powerful a good graph can be. To that end, Figure <a 
href="#x37-870021">5.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:snowmap1 --></a> shows a redrawing of one of the
most famous data visualisations of all time. This is John Snow’s 1854 map of cholera deaths.
The map is elegant in its simplicity. In the background we have a street map which
helps orient the viewer. Over the top we see a large number of small dots, each one
representing the location of a cholera case. The larger symbols show the location of water
pumps, labelled by name. Even the most casual inspection of the graph makes it very
clear that the source of the outbreak is almost certainly the Broad Street pump. Upon
viewing this graph Dr Snow arranged to have the handle removed from the pump and
ended the outbreak that had killed over 500 people. Such is the power of a good data
visualisation.
</p><!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >   The goals in this chapter are twofold. First, to discuss several fairly standard graphs that we use
a lot when analysing and presenting data, and second to show you how to create these
graphs in jamovi. The graphs themselves tend to be pretty straightforward, so in one
respect this chapter is pretty simple. Where people usually struggle is learning how
to produce graphs, and especially learning how to produce good graphs. Fortunately,
learning how to draw graphs in jamovi is reasonably simple as long as you’re not too
picky about what your graph looks like. What I mean when I say this is that jamovi
has a lot of very good default graphs, or plots, that most of the time produce a clean,
high-quality graphic. However, on those occasions when you do want to do something
non-standard, or if you need to make highly speciﬁc changes to the ﬁgure, then the
graphics functionality in jamovi is not yet capable of supporting advanced work or detail

 id="x37-880005.1"></a>Histograms</h3>
<!--l. 32--><p class="noindent" >Let’s begin with the humble <span id="textcolor106">histogram</span>. Histograms are one of the simplest and most useful ways
of visualising data. They make most sense when you have an interval or ratio scale variable (e.g.,
the afl.margins data from Chapter <a 
href="lsjch4.html#x27-670004">4<!--tex4ht:ref: ch:descriptives --></a>) and what you want to do is get an overall impression of the
variable. Most of you probably know how histograms work, since they’re so widely used,
but for the sake of completeness I’ll describe them. All you do is divide up the possible
values into <span id="textcolor107">bins</span> and then count the number of observations that fall within each bin.
This count is referred to as the frequency or density of the bin and is displayed as a
vertical bar. Ihe AFL winning margins data there are 33 games in which the winning
margin was less than 10 points and it is this fact that is represented by the height of the
leftmost bar that we showed earlier in Chapter <a 
href="lsjch4.html#x27-670004">4<!--tex4ht:ref: ch:descriptives --></a>, Figure <a 
href="lsjch4.html#x27-670032">4.2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:histogram1 --></a>. With these earlier graphs
we used an advanced plotting package in R which, for now, is beyond the capability
of jamovi. But jamovi gets us close, and drawing this histogram in jamovi is pretty
straightforward. Open up the ‘plots’ options under ‘Exploration’ - ‘Descriptives’ and click
the ‘histogram’ check box, as in Figure <a 
href="#x37-880012">5.2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:jamovi_histogram --></a>. jamovi defaults to labelling the y-axis as
‘density’ and the x-axis with the variable name. The <span id="textcolor108">bins</span> are selected automatically, and
there is no scale, or count, information on the y-axis unlike the previous Figure <a 
href="lsjch4.html#x27-670032">4.2<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:histogram1 --></a>.
But this does not matter too much because after all what we are really interested in is
our impression of the shape of the distribution: is it normally distributed or is there a
skew or kurtosis? Our ﬁrst impressions of these characteristics come from drawing a
<span id="textcolor109">histogram</span>.

<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   One additional feature that jamovi provides is the ability to plot a ‘Density’ curve. You can do
this by clicking the ‘Density’ check box under the ‘Plots’ options (and unchecking ‘Histogram’), and
this gives us the plot shown in Figure <a 
href="#x37-880023">5.3<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:histogram2 --></a>. A density plot visualises the distribution of data over a
continuous interval or time period. This chart is a variation of a histogram that uses <span id="textcolor110">kernel
smoothing</span> to plot values, allowing for smoother distributions by smoothing out the noise. The
peaks of a density plot help display where values are concentrated over the interval. An advantage
density plots have over histograms is that they are better at determining the distribution shape
because they’re not aﬀected by the number of bins used (each bar used in a typical histogram). A
histogram comprising of only 4 bins wouldn’t produce a distinguishable enough shape of
distribution as a 20-bin histogram would. However, with density plots, this isn’t an
issue.

<!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   Although this image would need a lot of cleaning up in order to make a good presentation
graphic (i.e., one you’d include in a report), it nevertheless does a pretty good job of describing the
data. In fact, the big strength of a histogram or density plot is that (properly used) it does show
the entire spread of the data, so you can get a pretty good sense about what it looks
like. The downside to histograms is that they aren’t very compact. Unlike some of the
other plots I’ll talk about it’s hard to cram 20-30 histograms into a single image without
overwhelming the viewer. And of course, if your data are nominal scale then histograms are
useless.

<!--l. 59--><p class="noindent" >Another alternative to histograms is a <span id="textcolor111">boxplot</span>, sometimes called a “box and whiskers” plot. Like
histograms they’re most suited to interval or ratio scale data. The idea behind a boxplot is to
provide a simple visual depiction of the median, the interquartile range, and the range of the data.
And because they do so in a fairly compact way boxplots have become a very popular statistical
graphic, especially during the exploratory stage of data analysis when you’re trying to understand
the data yourself. Let’s have a look at how they work, again using the afl.margins data as our
example.

<!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >   The easiest way to describe what a boxplot looks like is just to draw one. Click on the ‘Box
plot’ check box and you will get the plot shown on the lower right of Figure <a 
href="#x37-890014">5.4<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:boxplot1 --></a>. jamovi has drawn
the most basic boxplot possible. When you look at this plot this is how you should interpret it: the
thick line in the middle of the box is the median; the box itself spans the range from the 25th
percentile to the 75th percentile; and the “whiskers” go out to the most extreme data point
that doesn’t exceed a certain bound. By default, this value is 1.5 times the interquartile
range (IQR), calculated as 25th percentile - (1.5*IQR) for the lower boundary,
and 75th percentile + (1.5*IQR) for the upper boundary. Any observation whose
value falls outside this range is plotted as a circle or dot instead of being covered by the
whiskers, and is commonly referred to as an <span id="textcolor112">outlier</span>. For our AFL margins data there
are two observations that fall outside this range, and these observations are plotted as
dots (the upper boundary is 107, and looking over the data column in the spreadsheet
there are two observations with values higher than this, 108 and 116, so these are the
dots).

<!--l. 83--><p class="indent" >   A variation to the traditional box plot is the violin plot. Violin plots are similar to box
plots except that they also show the kernel probability density of the data at diﬀerent
values. Typically, violin plots will include a marker for the median of the data and a box
indicating the interquartile range, as in standard box plots. In jamovi you can achieve
this sort of functionality by checking both the ‘Violin’ and the ’Box plot’ check boxes.
See Figure <a 
href="#x37-900015">5.5<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:boxplot2 --></a>, which also has the ‘Data’ check box turned on to show the actual data
points on the plot. This does tend to make the graph a bit too busy though, in my
opinion. Clarity is simplicity, so in practice it might be better to just use a simple box
plot.

wanted separate boxplots showing the AFL margins not just for 2010 but for every year between
1987 and 2010. To do that the ﬁrst thing we’ll have to do is ﬁnd the data. These are stored in the
aflsmall2.csv ﬁle. So let’s load it into jamovi and see what is in it. You will see that it is a pretty
big data set. It contains 4296 games and the variables that we’re interested in. What we want to do
is have jamovi draw boxplots for the margin variable, but plotted separately for each year. The
way to do this is to move the year variable across into the ‘Split by’ box, as in Figure

<!--l. 120--><p class="indent" >   Because the boxplot automatically separates out those observations that lie outside a certain
range, depicting them with a dot in jamovi, people often use them as an informal method for
detecting <span id="textcolor113">outliers</span>: observations that are “suspiciously” distant from the rest of the data. Here’s an
example. Suppose that I’d drawn the boxplot for the AFL margins data and it came up
looking like Figure <a 
href="#x37-920018">5.8<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:boxplot4 --></a>. It’s pretty clear that something funny is going on with two of the
observations. Apparently, there were two games in which the margin was over 300 points! That
doesn’t sound right to me. Now that I’ve become suspicious it’s time to look a bit more
closely at the data. In jamovi you can quickly ﬁnd out which of these observations are
suspicious and then you can go back to the raw data to see if there has been a mistake
in data entry. To do this you need to set up a ﬁlter so that only those observations
with values over a certain threshold are included. In our example, the threshold is over
300, so that is the ﬁlter we will create. First, click on the ‘Filters’ button at the top
of the jamovi window, and then type ‘margin   300’ into the ﬁlter ﬁeld, as in Figure

<!--l. 131--><p class="indent" >   This ﬁlter creates a new column in the spreadsheet view where only those observations that
pass the ﬁlter are included. One neat way to quickly identify which observations these are is to tell
jamovi to produce a ‘Frequency table’ (in the ‘Exploration’ - ‘Descriptives’ window) for the ID
variable (which must be a nominal variable otherwise the Frequency table is not produced). In
Figure <a 
href="#x37-9200310">5.10<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:filter2 --></a> you can see that the ID values for the observations where the margin was over 300 are
14 and 134. These are suspicious cases, or observations, where you should go back to the original
data source to ﬁnd out what is going on.

<!--l. 142--><p class="indent" >   Usually you ﬁnd that someone has just typed in the wrong number. Whilst this might seem like
a silly example, I should stress that this kind of thing actually happens a lot. Real world data sets
are often riddled with stupid errors, especially when someone had to type something into a
computer at some point. In fact, there’s actually a name for this phase of data analysis and in
practice it can take up a huge chunk of our time: <span id="textcolor114">data cleaning</span>. It involves searching for typing
mistakes (“typos”), missing data and all sorts of other obnoxious errors in raw data
ﬁles.
</p><!--l. 144--><p class="indent" >   For less extreme values, even if they are ﬂagged in a a boxplot as outliers, the decision about
whether to include outliers or exclude them in any analysis depends heavily on why you think the
data look they way they do and what you want to use the data for. You really need to exercise
good judgement here. If the outlier looks legitimate to you, then keep it. In any case, I’ll return to
the topic again in Section <a

<!--l. 149--><p class="noindent" >Another form of graph that you often want to plot is the <span id="textcolor115">bar graph</span>. Let’s use the afl.finalists
data set with the afl.finalists variable that I introduced in Section <a 
href="lsjch4.html#x27-740004.1.6">4.1.6<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:mode --></a>. What I want to do is
draw a bar graph that displays the number of ﬁnals that each team has played in over the time
spanned by the afl.finalists data set. There are lots of teams, but I am particularly interested
in just four: Brisbane, Carlton, Fremantle and Richmond. So the ﬁrst step is to set up a ﬁlter so
just those four teams are included in the bar graph. This is straightforward in jamovi and you can
do it by using the ‘Filters’ function that we used previously. Open up the ‘Filters’ screen and type
in the following:
</p><!--l. 152--><p class="indent" >   afl.finalists == ‘Brisbane’ or afl.finalists == ‘Carlton’ <br

</p><!--l. 154--><p class="indent" >   When you have done this you will see, in the ‘Data’ view, that jamovi has ﬁltered out all values
apart from those we have speciﬁed. Next, open up the ‘Exploration’ - ‘Descriptives’ window and
click on the ‘Bar plot’ check box (remember to move the ‘aﬂ.ﬁnalists’ variable across into the
‘Variables’ box so that jamovi knows which variable to use). You should then get a bar graph,
something like that shown in Figure <a

<!--l. 173--><p class="noindent" >Perhaps I’m a simple minded person, but I love pictures. Every time I write a new scientiﬁc paper
one of the ﬁrst things I do is sit down and think about what the pictures will be. In my head an
article is really just a sequence of pictures linked together by a story. All the rest of it is just
window dressing. What I’m really trying to say here is that the human visual system
is a very powerful data analysis tool. Give it the right kind of information and it will
supply a human reader with a massive amount of knowledge very quickly. Not for nothing
do we have the saying “a picture is worth a thousand words”. With that in mind, I
think that this is one of the most important chapters in the book. The topics covered
were:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">Common plots. Much of the chapter was focused on standard graphs that statisticians
      like  to  produce:  histograms  (Section <a 
href="#x37-880005.1">5.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:hist --></a>),  boxplots  (Section <a 
href="#x37-890005.2">5.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:boxplots --></a>)  and  bar  graphs
      (Section <a

      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Saving  image  ﬁles.  Importantly,  we  also  covered  how  to  export  your  pictures
      (Section <a 
href="#x37-940005.4">5.4<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:saveimage --></a>)</li></ul>
<!--l. 181--><p class="indent" >   One ﬁnal thing to point out. Whilst jamovi produces some really neat default graphics, editing
the plots is currently not possible. For more advanced graphics and plotting capability the packages
available in R are much more powerful. One of the most popular graphics systems is
provided by the ggplot2 package (see <a 
href="http://ggplot2.org/" class="url" >http://ggplot2.org/</a>), which is loosely based on
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
“The grammar of graphics” (Wilkinson, Wills, Rope, Norton, and Dubbs 2006). It’s not
for novices. You need to have a pretty good grasp of R before you can start using it,
and even then it takes a while to really get the hang of it. But when you’re ready it’s
worth taking the time to teach yourself, because it’s a much more powerful and cleaner
system.
