<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >In this chapter I’ll discuss how to get started in jamovi. I’ll brieﬂy talk about how to download
and install jamovi, but most of the chapter will be focused on getting you started with
ﬁnding your way around the jamovi GUI. Our goal in this chapter is not to learn any
statistical concepts: we’re just trying to learn the basics of how jamovi works and get
comfortable interacting with the system. To do this we’ll spend a bit of time looking at
datasets and variables. In doing so, you’ll get a bit of a feel for what it’s like to work in
jamovi.
</p><!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >   However, before going into any of the speciﬁcs, it’s worth talking a little about why you might
want to use jamovi at all. Given that you’re reading this you’ve probably got your own reasons.
However, if those reasons are “because that’s what my stats class uses”, it might be worth
explaining a little why your lecturer has chosen to use jamovi for the class. Of course, I don’t
really know why other people choose jamovi so I’m really talking about why I use it.
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">It’s sort of obvious but worth saying anyway: doing your statistics on a computer is
      faster, easier and more powerful than doing statistics by hand. Computers excel at
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
      mindless repetitive tasks, and a lot of statistical calculations are both mindless and
      repetitive. For most people the only reason to ever do statistical calculations with pencil
      and paper is for learning purposes. In my class I do occasionally suggest doing some
      calculations that way, but the only real value to it is pedagogical. It does help you to
      get a “feel” for statistics to do some calculations yourself, so it’s worth doing it once.
      But only once!
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Doing statistics in a conventional spreadsheet (e.g., Microsoft Excel) is generally a
      bad idea in the long run. Although many people likely feel more familiar with them,
      spreadsheets are very limited in terms of what analyses they allow you do. If you get
      into the habit of trying to do your real life data analysis using spreadsheets then you’ve
      dug yourself into a very deep hole.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Avoiding  proprietary  software  is  a  very  good  idea.  There  are  a  lot  of  commercial
      packages out there that you can buy, some of which I like and some of which I don’t.
      They’re usually very glossy in their appearance and generally very powerful (much
      more powerful than spreadsheets). However, they’re also very expensive. Usually, the
      company sells “student versions” (crippled versions of the real thing) very cheaply, and
      then they they sell full powered “educational versions” at a price that makes me wince.
      They will also sell commercial licences with a staggeringly high price tag. The business
      model here is to suck you in during your student days and then leave you dependent
      on their tools when you go out into the real world. It’s hard to blame them for trying,
      but personally I’m not in favour of shelling out thousands of dollars if I can avoid it.
      And you can avoid it. If you make use of packages like jamovi that are open source and
      free you never get trapped having to pay exorbitant licensing fees.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Something that you might not appreciate now, but will love later on if you do anything
      involving data analysis, is the fact that jamovi is basically a sophisticated front end for
      the free R statistical programming language. When you download and install R you
      get all the basic “packages” and those are very powerful on their own. However, because
      R is so open and so widely used, it’s become something of a standard tool in statistics
      and so lots of people write their own packages that extend the system. And these are
      freely available too. One of the consequences of this, I’ve noticed, is that if you look at
      recent advanced data analysis textbooks then a lot of them use R.</li></ul>
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >Those are the main reasons I use jamovi. It’s not without its ﬂaws, though. It’s relatively

there is not a huge set of textbooks and other resources to support it, and it has a few
annoying quirks that we’re all pretty much stuck with, but on the whole I think the
strengths outweigh the weakness; more so than any other option I’ve encountered so
far.

needs to be installed on a “computer”, which is a magical box that does cool things and delivers
free ponies. Or something along those lines; I may be confusing computers with the iPad marketing
campaigns. Anyway, jamovi is freely distributed online and you can download it from the jamovi
homepage, which is:

<!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   These levels are designated by the symbol in the header of the variable’s column.
</p><!--l. 75--><p class="indent" >   The ID variable type is unique to jamovi. It’s intended for variables that contain identiﬁers that
you would almost never want to analyse. For example, a persons name, or a participant ID.
Specifying an ID variable type can improve performance when interacting with very large data
sets.
</p><!--l. 77--><p class="indent" >   Nominal variables are for categorical variables which are text labels, for example a column
called Gender with the values Male and Female would be nominal. So would a person’s name.
Nominal variable values can also have a numeric value. These variables are used most often
when importing data which codes values with numbers rather than text. For example, a
column in a dataset may contain the values 1 for males, and 2 for females. It is possible to
add nice ‘human-readable’ labels to these values with the variable editor (more on this
later).
</p><!--l. 79--><p class="indent" >   Ordinal variables are like Nominal variables, except the values have a speciﬁc order. An example
is a Likert scale with 3 being ‘strongly agree’ and -3 being ‘strongly disagree’.
</p><!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >   Continuous variables are variables which exist on a continuous scale. Examples might be height
or weight. This is also referred to as ‘Interval’ or ‘Ratio scale’.
</p><!--l. 83--><p class="indent" >   In addition, you can also specify diﬀerent data types: variables have a data type of either ‘Text’,
‘Integer’ or ‘Decimal’.
</p><!--l. 85--><p class="indent" >   When starting with a blank spreadsheet and typing values in the variable type will change
automatically depending on the data you enter. This is a good way to get a feel for which variable
types go with which sorts of data. Similarly, when opening a data ﬁle jamovi will try and guess the
variable type from the data in each column. In both cases this automatic approach may not be
correct, and it may be necessary to manually specify the variable type with the variable
editor.
</p><!--l. 87--><p class="indent" >   The variable editor can be opened by selecting ‘Setup’ from the data tab or by double-clicking
on the variable column header. The variable editor allows you to change the name of the variable
and, for data variables, the variable type, the order of the levels, and the label displayed for each
level. Changes can be applied by clicking the ‘tick’ to the top right. The variable editor can be
dismissed by clicking the ‘Hide’ arrow.

<!--l. 135--><p class="noindent" >There are several diﬀerent types of ﬁles that are likely to be relevant to us when doing data
analysis. There are two in particular that are especially important from the perspective of this
book: </p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">jamovi ﬁles are those with a .omv ﬁle extension. This is the standard kind of ﬁle that
      jamovi uses to store data, and variables and analyses.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Comma separated value (csv) ﬁles are those with a .csv ﬁle extension. These are just
      regular old text ﬁles and they can be opened with many diﬀerent software programs.
      It’s quite typical for people to store data in csv ﬁles, precisely because they’re so simple.</li></ul>
<!--l. 141--><p class="indent" >   There are also several other kinds of data ﬁle that you might want to import into jamovi. For
instance, you might want to open Microsoft Excel spreadsheets (.xls ﬁles), or data ﬁles that
have been saved in the native ﬁle formats for other statistics software, such as SPSS or
SAS. Whichever ﬁle formats you are using, it’s a good idea to create a folder or folders
especially for your jamovi data sets and analyses and to make sure you keep these backed up
regularly.

into.

<!--l. 184--><p class="noindent" >The ﬁrst thing I should point out is that if your data are saved as a text ﬁle but aren’t quite in the
proper csv format then there’s still a pretty good chance that jamovi will be able to open it.
You just need to try it and see if it works. Sometimes though you will need to change
some of the formatting. The ones that I’ve often found myself needing to change are:
</p>
                                                                                          

                                                                                          
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">header. A lot of the time when you’re storing data as a csv ﬁle the ﬁrst row actually
      contains the column names and not data. If that’s not true then it’s a good idea to open
      up the csv ﬁle in a spreadsheet programme such as Open Oﬃce and add the header
      row manually.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">sep. As the name “comma separated value” indicates, the values in a row of a csv ﬁle
      are usually separated by commas. This isn’t universal, however. In Europe the decimal
      point is typically written as , instead of . and as a consequence it would be somewhat
      awkward to use , as the separator. Therefore it is not unusual to use ; instead of , as
      the separator. At other times, I’ve seen a TAB character used.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">quote. It’s conventional in csv ﬁles to include a quoting character for textual data.
      As you can see by looking at the booksales.csv ﬁle, this is usually a double quote
      character, &#x0022;. But sometimes there is no quoting character at all, or you might see a
      single quote mark ’ used instead.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">skip. It’s actually very common to receive CSV ﬁles in which the ﬁrst few rows have
      nothing to do with the actual data. Instead, they provide a human readable summary
      of where the data came from, or maybe they include some technical info that doesn’t
      relate to the data.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">missing values. Often you’ll get given data with missing values. For one reason or
      another, some entries in the table are missing. The data ﬁle needs to include a “special”
      value to indicate that the entry is missing. By default jamovi assumes that this value is
      99<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="lsj24.html#fn4x4"><sup class="textsuperscript">4</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x20-59001f4"></a> ,
      for both numeric and text data, so you should make sure that, where necessary, all
      missing values in the csv ﬁle are replaced with 99 (or -9999; whichever you choose)
      before opening / importing the ﬁle into jamovi. Once you have opened / imported
      the ﬁle into jamovi all the missing values are converted to blank cells in the jamovi
      spreadsheet view.</li></ul>

we have many more possibilities. For example, you might want to read data ﬁles in from other
statistics programs. Since SPSS is probably the most widely used statistics package in psychology,
it’s worth mentioning that jamovi can also import SPSS data ﬁles (ﬁle extension .sav). Just follow
the instructions above for how to open a csv ﬁle, but this time navigate to the .sav ﬁle you want to
import. For SPSS ﬁles, jamovi will regard all values as missing if they are regarded as
“system missing” ﬁles in SPSS. The ‘Default missings’ value does not seem to work
as expected when importing SPSS ﬁles, so be aware of this - you might need another
step: import the SPSS ﬁle into jamovi, then export as a csv ﬁle before re-opening in
jamovi.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

<!--l. 229--><p class="noindent" >There’s one last thing I should cover in this chapter: how to quit jamovi. It’s not
hard, just close the program the same way you would any other program. However,

to this: saving any changes to the data set, and saving the analyses that you
ran.
</p><!--l. 231--><p class="indent" >   It is good practice to save any changes to the data set as a new data set. That
way you can always go back to the original data. To save any changes in jamovi,
select ‘Export’...‘Data’ from the main jamovi menu (button with three
horizontal bars in the top left) and create a new ﬁle name for the changed data
set.
</p><!--l. 233--><p class="indent" >   Alternatively, you can save both the changed data and any analyses you have
undertaken by saving as a jamovi ﬁle. To do this, from the main jamovi menu
select ‘Save as’ and type in a ﬁle name for this ‘jamovi ﬁle (.omv)’. Remember to
save the ﬁle in a location where you can ﬁnd it again later. I usually create a new
