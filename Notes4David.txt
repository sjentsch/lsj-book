Notes for David:
- change file extension for img/factoranalysis/fa6.PNG to small letters
- in chapter12_regression.tex (add file extension .png)
  \epsfig{file = ../img/regression/reg1,clip=true, width = 14cm} → \epsfig{file = ../img/regression/reg1.png, clip=true, width = 14cm}
  \epsfig{file = ../img/regression/reg2,clip=true, width = 14cm} → \epsfig{file = ../img/regression/reg2.png, clip=true, width = 14cm}
- in chapter16_bayes.tex: is it intended that \subsection is lowercase here (not \SUBSECTION as in the remaining document)?
- in chapter04_descriptives.tex, there is one occurence of a lowercase subsection (\subsection{Epilogue: Good descriptive statistics are descriptive!})

- I took the liberty to change the tables to APA-style, that was for several reasons: one was, that the conversion to HTML did not produce nice looking tables when using vertical rulers; the other is that I thougt it might be litle confusing if the figures with the output are in APA-style whereas the tables are not; one issue is still to solve though to have a little more space when using \hline
